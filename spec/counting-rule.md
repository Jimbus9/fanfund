# Counting rule

**Version 2 · 23 October 2026**

*Changed in v2: the vote-tally section is removed. Spending is decided by funding
rather than by a vote, so there is nothing to weigh or count. See "There are no
vote tallies" below for why, and the proposal and settlement format for what
replaced it.*

How every number this movement publishes is computed. Two people applying this
document to the same public data must reach the same answer. If they do not,
this document is at fault and should be corrected.

Principle 10 of the declaration: no figure is published that cannot be checked
by a stranger. This is the document that makes that possible.

## The unit of account is bitcoin

The authoritative figure is in **BTC**, not pounds.

A pound figure may be shown alongside it, and when it is, it must be marked as
an indicative conversion at the time of display. It is never the headline and
it is never archived as a fact.

The reason is not ideology. Priced in pounds, an ordinary fall in the bitcoin
price appears to shrink the movement while the target stands still, and nobody
whose money is locked can do anything about it. Priced in bitcoin, the movement
holds exactly what it held yesterday, and what has changed is the cost of the
thing it is trying to buy. The second description is the true one, and it keeps
a price source out of the only number that has to be beyond argument.

## The three states of a lock

Read directly from the blockchain, never from any record we keep.

| State | Condition | Counted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Locked** | Coins present at the lock address, locktime in the future | **Yes** |
| **Lapsed** | Coins present, locktime reached | No — published separately |
| **Withdrawn** | Coins no longer at the address | No |

**Lapsed money is not counted**, whether or not the owner has moved it. On the
date a lock reaches, the owner can spend those coins with a single signature,
which makes them indistinguishable from any other coins somebody happens to
own — and counting those would return the headline figure to meaninglessness.

**The lapsed figure is published on its own.** It is the renewal pipeline, and
the gap between "members drifting away" and "members who have not got round to
it" is the most useful health signal this movement has. Concealing it would be
a breach of principle 10.

## The committed total

```
committed = Σ (confirmed balance of every lock address in state "locked"
               whose balance is at least the minimum)
```

- Balances are read from the blockchain at a stated moment, and the moment is
  published with the figure.
- **Unconfirmed transactions do not count.** A lock counts from its first
  confirmation.
- Each lock address is counted once. An address appearing twice in the register
  is counted once.

## The minimum

**200,000 satoshis.** A lock below this does not count towards the committed
total.

Expressed in satoshis rather than pounds so it does not drift with the price.
Its only purpose is to stop a large number of worthless locks inflating the
figures — at this level, faking ten thousand of them would cost real money.

**Changing it.** The minimum may be revised, in a published amendment to this
document carrying a reason and an effective date, so that anyone can recompute
the totals under both the old rule and the new one and see exactly what the
change did.

**Existing locks are grandfathered.** A raised minimum never disqualifies a
lock that qualified when it was made. Otherwise a price movement could silently
remove supporters from the count, which would be the opposite of the point.

## The member count

Two different numbers, and they must never be conflated.

**Signatories** — registrations that verify. Costs nothing to obtain, so it is
a measure of agreement rather than commitment, and it must never be presented
as a financial figure.

**Committed members** — distinct members holding at least one lock in state
"locked" at or above the minimum. This is the figure to quote alongside the
committed total, because the two describe the same group of people.

Where only one figure is given, it must be the committed one, and it must be
labelled.

## There are no vote tallies

Spending is not decided by a vote, so there is nothing to tally. A supporter who
wants a purchase signs their own coins into it; one who does not, does nothing.
Declaration principle 6 — *spending is weighted by what each member has
committed* — is satisfied by arithmetic rather than by counting, which removes a
step that could be got wrong or argued over.

An earlier version of this document specified vote weights measured at a declared
block height. That machinery was inherited from a design in which money sat in a
pool and somebody had to be told where to send it. Nobody holds anybody's money
here, so there was nothing left for it to instruct.

How a proposal is published, funded and settled is in the **proposal and
settlement format**. What this document still governs is the only figure that
matters to it: the running total of commitments, which is computed from the
published pile of signatures rather than from the chain, and must never be summed
across proposals.

Influence cannot be rented in any case, because committed money cannot be
borrowed for an afternoon. That is why no decay curve, holding-period formula or
anti-gaming measure appears anywhere: the lock already does that work.

The one place a genuine ballot survives is **directing the club** — one member,
one vote, inside the society's own rules, because a decision that moves no money
cannot be funded. That exists only once a stake does, and is not specified here.

## Figures that must not be published

- **Holdings.** Bitcoin a supporter merely owns, however much of it there is.
- **Intentions.** Pledges, promises or expressions of support not backed by a
  lock.
- **A peak or record figure.** Only the present matters. A record flatters and
  is not load-bearing.
- **Any pound figure presented as authoritative** rather than as an indicative
  conversion at a stated moment.

## Amendments

This document is versioned and may change. The declaration cannot. If the two
ever appear to conflict, the declaration governs and this document is wrong.
