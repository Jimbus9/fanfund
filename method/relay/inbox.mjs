// The relay inbox job. Run by .github/workflows/relay-inbox.yml every few
// minutes, in the Crowdlock's own repository, with no secrets: it writes only
// to its own register files, and the workflow commits them.
//
// For every Crowdlock file in crowdlocks/ that names relays: collect the
// records posted for it, put each through the endpoints' own judgement
// (method/js/inbox.mjs), and write the register if anything was added. Prints one
// line per record, so the job's log is a public account of what was taken
// and what was refused, and why.
