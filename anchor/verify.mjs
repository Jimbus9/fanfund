// Two separate questions, and the first is answerable with no internet at all:
//
//   1. Does this proof belong to this file?  Pure arithmetic — the proof
//      carries the fingerprint it was made for, and either that matches the
//      file sitting here or the proof is for something else.
//
//   2. Is it in the blockchain yet?  This needs to look at Bitcoin. A fresh
//      proof points at the calendar servers; a finished one points at a block.
//      If it is still waiting, this asks the calendars whether they are ready
//      and writes the completed proof back. (OpenTimestamps calls this step
//      "upgrading", which sounds like installing a newer version of
//      something. It is not. It is collecting the missing half of a proof.
//      That word is kept out of what this prints.)
//
// A proof that fails the first question is worthless and should be deleted.
// A proof that passes the first and not the second is simply young.
