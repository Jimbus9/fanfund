//   node anchor/stamp.mjs ../registrations.json   or any other file

// WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It puts the file's fingerprint into
// the blockchain, so the block's timestamp proves a file with exactly these
// bytes existed before that moment. Nobody can later produce a different
// "original" with an earlier date, because they would need a fingerprint in
// an earlier block, and they cannot go back and put one there.
//
// It is NOT a backup. If the declaration vanished tomorrow, this would not
// bring it back — somebody still has to be holding a copy. What it changes is
// that whoever holds one can PROVE it is the original, to anyone, forever.
// That is the difference between "detectable if somebody kept a copy" and
// "provable by anybody".
//
// It costs nothing and spends none of your bitcoin. Public calendar servers
// collect fingerprints from everybody, combine thousands of them into one,
// and put that single value into one Bitcoin transaction — paying the fee
// themselves. The proof this writes shows mathematically that your fingerprint
// is inside that batch, and it keeps working even if the calendars disappear
// afterwards.
//
// The proof is not complete the moment this finishes. The calendars need a
// few hours to get their transaction into a block. Run verify.mjs tomorrow to
// finish it off. Both files belong in the repository.
