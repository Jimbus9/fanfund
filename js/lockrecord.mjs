// Deciding whether a lock may be added to the register, and what the register
// looks like afterwards.
//
// This is the whole judgement of the lock endpoint, kept apart from the network
// code around it, exactly as js/append.mjs is for joining. It touches nothing
// outside itself — no fetch, no clock — so it can be tested properly. The one
// fact it needs from the blockchain (how much confirmed money sits at the lock
// address) is fetched by the caller and passed in.
//
// WHY THE REGISTER HAS TO BE TOLD ABOUT A LOCK AT ALL. A lock address is the
// hash of its script, so the chain shows only "some coins at some address"
// until the lock is spent. Nobody can find a lock by looking; its owner has to
// say "this address is my lock, built from these two keys and this date". The
// register then rebuilds the address from those three things and accepts the
// lock only if it comes out identical — which is spec/lock-format.md,
// "Verifying a lock", steps 1 to 4.
//
// What this can decide is narrow by design. It cannot invent a lock: an address
// that does not rebuild from the stated terms is refused, and the terms decide
// who can ever move the coins. It can only accept a genuine lock, or refuse one.
//
// It deliberately does NOT refuse a lock below the minimum. The minimum is a
// counting rule, not a validity rule (spec/counting-rule.md): such a lock is
// published and simply not counted.
