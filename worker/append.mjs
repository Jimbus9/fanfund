// Deciding whether a submission may join the register, and what the register
// looks like afterwards.
//
// This is the whole judgement of the join endpoint, kept deliberately apart
// from the network code that surrounds it. It touches nothing outside itself:
// no fetch, no clock, no environment. That is what lets it be tested properly,
// and the network shell around it stays thin enough to read in one sitting.
//
// What it is allowed to decide is narrow by design. It cannot create a member
// who did not sign, because it cannot produce a signature. It can only accept
// a valid one, refuse an invalid one, or refuse a duplicate.
